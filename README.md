## 🏛️ SOLID Development Principles Implementation

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component has a clearly defined, single purpose:
- **DataLoader**: Exclusively handles CSV data ingestion and parsing
- **FeatureEngineer**: Focuses solely on data transformation and feature preparation
- **ModelEvaluator**: Dedicated to model performance assessment
- **EnsemblePredictor**: Manages prediction orchestration across multiple models

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The architecture enables extension without modification:
- Interface-based design allows new model types without core changes
- Plugin architecture for adding new AI capabilities
- Extensible prediction pipeline supporting additional algorithms
- Modular UI components for feature expansion

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Consistent interfaces ensure reliable component substitution:
- All trainers implement common interfaces for seamless swapping
- Prediction engines follow consistent contracts
- Service layer abstractions enable implementation flexibility

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Focused interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies:
- Separate interfaces for different model types (regression vs. classification)
- Distinct service contracts for data loading, training, and prediction
- Specialized UI service interfaces for different application concerns

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules depend on abstractions, not implementations:
- Dependency injection throughout the application
- Service registration and lifecycle management
- Testable architecture through interface-based design
